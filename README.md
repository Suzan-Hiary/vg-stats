## Data Analysis with Pandas

After Numpy, the next big player in Data Science field is Pandas.

Pandas makes it much simpler to organize tabular data and apply statistical analysis to it.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Video Game Sales - Sales data from more than 16,500 games
Cycle Share Data set - Bicycle Trip Data from Seattle’s Cycle Share System

* Start two Jupyter Notebooks called vg-stats and bike-stats
* Add a markdown cell at the top of each notebook with the title of this assignment, an appropriate name for the data set, as well as your name and the date

* Load up each of these data sets into a Pandas DataFrame within each respective file.

* NOTE: There’s an issue with one of the CSV files. * You will need to find a way to handle that error… Google it, and work around it!
